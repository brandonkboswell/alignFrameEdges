alignFrameEdges
===============

This Indesign Script aligns frames on your page that are slightly misaligned.

You can set the threshold variable to determine how misaligned two frames can be.

This script properly ignores locked frames. Lock any frames you don't want aligned / aligned to.

Compatible with Indesign CS4+ (Maybe even older).
